      <div class="rantContent"><b>Rant may be subject to unjust determination:</b> The first type of love is the most common, and the least meaningful. I call it The Starbucks Love. Commonly used by white chicks more basic than the plot for Dora the Explorer, this holds the same value as saying that you absolutely LOVE the pumpkin spice Starbucks lattes. It means nothing, but to just like something in the 21st century, is like saying Inside Out was a good movie. It’s borderline hate speech. It isn’t mutual, and unfortunately it perfectly represents how I feel about Emma Watson.</div><div class="rantContent">The next type of love is the fondness one has for their family. It’s what intellects call Stockholm Syndrome. Wikipedia says, Stockholm syndrome is a condition which causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity. This pretty much sums up why smarter families don’t enjoy each other’s company. Alabama is a prime example of this theory because their linear family tree has a collective IQ that matches that of an empty Chef Boyardee ravioli can.</div><div class="rantContent">The final type is called attachment love. This occurs when two people share plenty of interests; such as the Yankees or Nickelback. These people usually die together after being crucified for liking the Yankees and Nickelback. This type of attraction leads to an attachment, and like conjoined twins, when one leaves, one or both die. This is obviously the most dangerous type of love, which is why my emotional barricade is stronger than the Great Wall of China.</div>
