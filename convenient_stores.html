      <div class="rantTitle">Convenient Stores</div>
      <div class="rantContent">There are two types of convenience stores: the ones that are so good they are bad... like the 2nd half of the Fast and Furious series. Or the stores that are so bad they are good… like the movie Spaceballs.
</div><div class="rantContent">Everytown has a liquor, lotto, and cigar shop. Whether they be attached to a greasy gas station or in the illegitimate state of Wyoming, they are all good to some degree. In the modernised portions of western U.S, you can find a really nice convenience store. These stores are cleaner than an episode of Mr. Rogers. The type of people that shop there eat gluten free salad smoothies off the floor. That’s how clean these establishments are.
</div><div class="rantContent">Nothing convenient is ever in these types of stores though. For instance, not one soul on the planet has ever wanted a single Birkenstock sandal with an iPod charger in the heel. But you can bet the front window is full of them to draw in tourists and dull minded millennials.
</div><div class="rantContent">Found more inland are the practical Speedways, truck stops, and Kwik-E-Marts of America. If you need a midnight snack, they have em’. Want to use a women’s bathroom with no lock? They got your back. If you’re running late for work and need to get your kid’s soccer team a halftime snack- well, they sell honey buns in bulk for seventy-five cents.
</div><div class="rantContent">At these stores, everyone is family. But just like family, no one wants to clean the bathroom. These places are dirtier than the toilet of a woman named Bertha. Seriously, I would like to meet the person who thought it would be funny to throw a water balloon full of syrup at the freezer section. I can’t get my pizza rolls without sticking to the floor. The prices draw you in, and the fluorescent lights disorient you from finding the exit. These places are human sized, systematic, socially adored fly-traps; and I’ll continue to go back at least once a week.</div>
