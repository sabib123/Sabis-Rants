      <div class="rantContent"><b>Rant may be subject to less than radical exageration: </b>As a kid, sand was the most interesting and terrifying thing you could encounter; like the modern day female. Most people don't view it as too dangerous, but that's just blissful ignorance. It was the cooler cousin to dirt. You, a six year old, could build an actual castle that could house very small wildlife. Which is why I immediately abandoned the structures faster than an obese man at the salad bar. The ocean was already a fairly barbaric place. Eat or be eaten, as some would say. But if you weren’t in the water, the beach wasn’t the best next option.</div><div class="rantContent">Jellyfish and crabs are in the sand. People go as far as calling a few weeks of the year “Jellyfish season.” Coast dwellers actually make a day of it. Imagine being in school for a first aid class and the topic goes from tending to a cut on the knee to spontaneous beach electrocution. I would move town if just walking could mean death to the faint of heart. I swear sand houses some of the scariest things on this planet. I would go face to face with a bear while wearing raw meat on my fanny than stand within spitting distance of those weaponized crabs. That’s God's way of keeping us fleshy humans in check.</div><div class="rantContent">When I was a kid quicksand was worse than AIDS. I thought on my 18th birthday I would just be walking to my car, take a wrong step, and die. At any time or place, quicksand could be the end of any of us. But let me tell you that I’ve been on this planet for over a decade and a half, but somehow never seen this silent killer. Cartoon Network has thoroughly lied to me. Frankly, I have no issue with that as long as I don't start sinking randomly.</div><div class="rantContent">Overall, unless you’re in school playground sandbox (which I legally cannot be), it’s a safe bet that you should finalize your last will and testament before venturing too far from society on coastal land.</div>
