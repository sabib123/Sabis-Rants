      <div class="rantContent"><b>Rant may be prone to the stress of a long distance relationship:</b> I have a real bone to pick with the sun so I’ll keep this quick. Firstly, we can’t see the sun. You can see a filtered version of the sun, but if you stared at the sun to get a full glamour shot, you’d go blind. What a prude.</div><div class="rantContent">The sun likes to keep a respectable 93 million mile distance from us. Just enough that we don’t get much closer. Earth is stuck here between a ball of red sand and a rock of poison. The sun is the anchor-like spouse that tells you your dreams of going to art school is dumb a waste of money. Gravity is complicated.</div><div class="rantContent">Past that, the sun is too bright. If I want to leave my house after a weekend of watching ‘Friends’ in my basement, I need to wear 2 pairs of sunglasses just to keep my retinas. This type of brightness from the sun also comes with snow, clean cement, or caucasians.</div><div class="rantContent">Sun burns are like God’s tax on existing. No one is safe for 12 hours a day, and that’s just how it is. If you wear anything to protect yourself, the sun punishes you- like the Chinese government. That’s because the wise-guys that wear full blown hoodies in the summer get sweaty, hot, and consequently, suffer from heatstroke.</div><div class="rantContent">The sun has too great a hold over us and I for one am sick of it. Unfortunately, there is no lightswitch or solar air conditioning at the moment. That’d be neat, but it would be more expensive than hosting the Superbowl. What a scam that is.</div>
