      <div class="rantContent"><b>Rant may be subject to obscure summarized story design:</b> Road trips have to be the worst way to spend vacation days; second to camping. Gas isn’t cheap and most families opt to fly to their destination, so let’s do the complete opposite. The destinations are always something that is so unbelievably boring that the passengers in the car attempt to force an aneurysm. If you have never been on a road trip, understand that you are the lucky one percent of our population that hasn’t yet heard 12 hours of complaints in a confined space with people that you’ve grown sick of years ago.</div><div class="rantContent">It is truly magical how polar and confused the weather is when you become a human pillow on a road trip. One moment, you’re drenched in someone else’s sweat; and the next, you’re inside of a scale 7 hurricane. The conditions you're under when on a long trip are surreal.</div><div class="rantContent">
      There’s always that glimpse of hope when you see the rest stop sign on the highway. It’s a piece of heaven that we were allowed to keep after Eve got a craving for apples. The relief of an air conditioned public bathroom on a road trip is unparalleled. And snack machines are like pockets of paradise. Cheap five star meal eaten on a bench next to a five hundred pound trucker that has better eating etiquette than half of your family. You can buy one bag of chips and have heart disease faster than malaria on a small African child. The snacks that are in those machines though are just rude. Twelve double chocolate double stuffed double dipped double diabetes Oreos for a quarter? It’d be a sin to not buy seven.</div><div class="rantContent">When you get back in your car, the interior in the course of four minutes has seemed to have shrunk 14 cubic feet. Despite the great time everyone had at the rest area, if one person says they need to use the bathroom again, the car might explode in sheer frustration. Unfortuneately, only one thing on these trips can settle the large scale agitation your family has developed for each other. Home.
