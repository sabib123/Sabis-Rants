      <div class="rantContent"><b>Rant may be subject to inordinate comparisons:</b> There’s no such thing as a good self made smore. It’s like a pizza. It tastes better after someone else has put their hands on it. It’s a relatively easy recipe, but I swear the execution is more complex than a damn Souffle. The graham crackers out of the package can either taste like a spongy Windex or crumble with the wind. I’ve never heard of any other food that is gone with a breeze. The structural integrity of those crackers are easily compared to that of a dying dandelion.</div><div class="rantContent">Next is the Hershey bar that is packaged like Fort Knox. You could use a different chocolate, but know that 9-1-1 has been called. Nobody wants to ruin the chocolate bar but the wrapper for children’s candy is more intricate than heart surgery. There’s always someone that can do it better after you embarrass yourself trying to open it.</div><div class="rantContent">The number of chocolate pieces you put on a smore determine how loved you were as a child. Your parents might have raised you to only use a conservative two chocolates like the Great Depression was just over this next hill. You might put on three to ensure that every bite has chocolate, this is normal. If you want to take out a second Mortgage on your house, then you can completely overlap your cracker with half a Hershey's bar. Then there are anarchists that only wish to watch the world suffer that use a full chocolate bar on one s'more. The Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos' of the world feel dirty doing this. Like, what a power move. These people have accepted that they are as unloved as Caitlyn Jenner, but are capable of making the greatest tasting smore ever.</div>
