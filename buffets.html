      <div class="rantContent"><b>Rant may be subject to hauntingly substantial accuracy: </b>Buffet lines are always too long. You can step in the food line more stuffed than a build-a-bear, and by the time you get to the mashed potatoes you just take the pan back to your table; that's how hungry you are. Plus, the most obsurd people on the planet congregate at buffets, and I can see why. You'll watch a man feed his pet raccoon a full ham and not look twice. You cant say anything, because the chocolate covered tortillas you brought back to your table will get you socially blacklisted by anyone from the outside world.</div><div class="rantContent">By your second trip to the buffet, the man with Frosted Flakes on top of his three meat pizza starts to look like a solid roommate. After your third plate of smothered meatloaf, you convince yourself the diet coke you ordered makes up for your sinful behavior.</div><div class="rantContent">Only at buffets can someone burp up their liver and fill the void with mac & cheese. This leads to post-meal paralysis: this is what happens when one's stomach expands into their spinal cord and prohibits them from leaving the dining establishment. You are forced to play around with silverware until you sweat off the eight pounds of sausage you foolishly believed was vegan.</div><div class="rantContent">Ultimately, every customer finds themself crying in their car unable to bend far enough to see their knees, making reservations same time and place next week.</div>
