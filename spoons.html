      <div class="rantContent"><b>Rant may be subject to rambling:</b> Spoons are good for like three things, cereal, soup, and ice cream. Everything else can be argued as a fork food. If you're cool enough, you can eat soup with a knife. Not just any knife though. One of those cool seraded ones that dudes with eye-patches use. You'll die a legend or in some sort asylum.</div><div class="rantContent">Some spoons so small they limit you to three lucky charms a bite. When you get to the bottom of the bowl the marshmallows you were saving for the end have melted. On the other side of the scale, the spoon can be so big they were used by Paul Bunyun and Uncle Sam to carve out the Grand Canyon for freedom. You have to unhinge your jaw to get that spoon in your mouth like a snake in the most barron regions of Africa attempting to swallow an elephant. Every bite of Ben and Jerry's sends you into a glucose based coma. You can eat so much with those spoons that you need to pray after each bite for your gluttonous ways.</div><div class="rantContent">My real issue is with sporks. The hanous crossover between spoons and forks was a relationship forged by Rosie O' Donnell in a desperate attempt to not be the most unattractive thing in a room. She failed, but not by much. The fact that the spork made it into any store is nothing short of a miracle. It's a cheap mans fun way of saving a whole 50 cents at his work friend's potluck barbecue his wife wanted to go to and he had to bring silverware.</div><div class="rantContent">Spoons have a very important role in our society. You can tell when meeting someone new their social status by the spoons they have. If they have the glass spoons the Queen eats with, they're stuck up. Those who have the classic metal spoons (maybe with a pattern on the bottom) are average members of society that are just trying to make a living. Wooden spoons are for vegans, and colorful spoons are for children. Those who weild plastic spoons though are for campers, college students, or lunatics. But really... what's the difference?</div>
